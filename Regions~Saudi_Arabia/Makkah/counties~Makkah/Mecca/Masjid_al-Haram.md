## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Masjid al-Haram (Arabic: ٱَلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْحَرَام, romanized: ʾal-Masjid ʾal-Ḥarām, 
> lit. 'The Sacred Mosque'), also known as the Sacred Mosque or the Great Mosque of Mecca, 
> is considered to be the most significant mosque in Islam. 
> 
> It encloses the vicinity of the Kaaba in Mecca, in the western region of Saudi Arabia. It is among the pilgrimage sites associated with the Hajj, which every Muslim must perform at least once in their lives if able. It is also the main site for the performance of ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, such as the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa.
>
> As of 2025, the Great Mosque is both the largest mosque in the world, and the most expensive building in the world. It has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years. It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
