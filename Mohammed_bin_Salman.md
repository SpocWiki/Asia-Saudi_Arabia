> Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud (Arabic: محمد بن سلمان آل سعود, romanized: Muḥammad bin Salmān Āl Su‘ūd; born 31 August 1985), also known as MbS, is the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, formally serving as Crown Prince and Prime Minister. 
> He is the heir apparent to the Saudi throne, the seventh son of King Salman of Saudi Arabia, 
> and  the grandson of the nation's founder, Ibn Saud.
>
> Mohammed is the first child of King Salman bin Abdulaziz 
> and his third wife, Fahda bint Falah Al Hithlain. 
> 
> After obtaining a law degree from King Saud University, 
> he became an advisor to his father in 2009. 
> 
> He was appointed deputy crown prince and defense minister 
> after his father became king in 2015, then promoted to crown prince in 2017. 
> Mohammed succeeded his father as prime minister in 2022.
>
> Since his appointment as crown prince in 2017, 
> Mohammed has introduced a series of liberal social and economic reforms; 
> these include curtailing the influence of the Wahhabi religious establishment 
> by restricting the powers of the religious police and improving women's rights, 
> removing the ban on female drivers in 2018, 
> and weakening the male-guardianship system in 2019. 
> 
> However, he also continues to repress women's rights activists. 
> His Saudi Vision 2030 program aims to reduce the Saudi economy's reliance on oil 
> through investment in other sectors such as technology and tourism. 
> 
> Despite these attempts at greater economic diversification, 
> the Saudi economy remains heavily reliant on oil. 
>
> Under Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has pursued a foreign policy 
> aimed at increasing the country's regional and international influence 
> and attracting greater foreign investment. 
> 
> The Kingdom has coordinated energy policy with Russia, strengthened its relations with China, 
> and expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with emerging economies 
> and regional powers in Africa, South America, and Asia. 
> 
> Mohammed was the architect of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen 
> and was involved in the escalation of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, 
> as well as a 2018 diplomatic dispute with Canada. 
>
> Mohammed leads an authoritarian government. 
> Those regarded as political dissidents are systematically repressed 
> through methods including imprisonment and torture; 
> citizens face arrest for social media posts that mildly criticise government policies. 
> 
> Between 2017 and 2019, he led the purge of competing Saudi political and economic elites, 
> alleging that they were involved in corruption 
> and seizing up to US$800 billion in assets and cash and cementing control over Saudi politics. 
> 
> A 2021 report by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) 
> found that Mohammed had ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
